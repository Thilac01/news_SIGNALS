News.lk,Discussion held to establish a stable programme to resolve issues faced by local big onion farmers,https://news.lk/news/discussion-held-to-establish-a-stable-programme-to-resolve-issues-faced-by-local-big-onion-farmers,"A discussion aimed at formulating a systematic programme to address the issues faced by local big onion farmers was held this morning (17) at the Presidential Secretariat. It was held under the patronage of the Minister of Agriculture, Livestock, Land and Irrigation, K. D. Lal Kantha, together with the Minister of Trade, Commerce, Food Security and Cooperative Development, Wasantha Samarasinghe.
Minister K. D. Lal kantha pointed out that while a concrete programme has long existed to safeguard paddy farmers, no such systematic plan had been developed for other crops. He stated that this is the first time a government is preparing a definitive programme to resolve the problems of big onion farmers, emphasising that the present government’s objective is to protect all farmers and improve their living standards.
During the discussion, it was highlighted that while seeking solutions to issues in the big onion sector, priority must be given to farmer-related challenges, while also ensuring onions are made available to consumers at affordable prices. The Minister further emphasised that all decisions must be based on accurate data.
Matters relating to increasing big onion production and the pricing mechanism were discussed in detail. The Department of Agriculture also presented a report outlining strategies and actions for sustainable production and marketing related to local big onion cultivation.
A planned programme is currently underway to increase big onion production from 17% in 2025 to 22% in 2026 and 27% in 2027.
It was also stressed that the government has decided to introduce a stable price for big onions in a manner that is fair to farmers. Lengthy discussions were held on steps that could be taken to improve storage and other facilities for farmers.
Farmers pointed out that sharp price fluctuations caused by wide market gaps posed a major challenge, yet they continue with their cultivation amidst this risk. They requested the government to provide the necessary facilities to allow them to continue big onion cultivation as a sector that could generate significant income.
As many of the farmers engaged in this sector operate on small landholdings, Minister K. D. Lalkantha emphasised the need to consider such factors when calculating production costs and making policy decisions. He also urged all farmers to register under the Department of Agrarian Development so that necessary interventions can be made promptly in emergencies.
Farmers expressed their appreciation to the government for intervening with a definitive programme, where something is being done for the first time to address their challenges. They noted their confidence in the present government and said they were ready to work together with it in seeking solutions.
